    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">With MODFLOW, the user specifies the dimensions of the grid (the number of columns, rows, and layers) and the width of the columns and rows. &#160;The user must also specify the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the grid origin. &#160;The grid origin is the location of the node in the first column, row, and layer. &#160;Columns are numbered from left to right. &#160;Rows are numbered from back to front. Layers are numbered from top to bottom. &#160;Thus the grid origin is the node at the left, back, top corner of the grid. &#160;The grid angle must also be specified. &#160;The angle is measured in degrees counterclockwise from the X-axis. &#160;The vertical exaggeration may also be specified. If it is not specified, a reasonable default value will be calculated. &#160;The user also specifies the elevation of the top of the model, the names of the aquifers, and the elevations of the bottoms of those aquifers.</text></para>
