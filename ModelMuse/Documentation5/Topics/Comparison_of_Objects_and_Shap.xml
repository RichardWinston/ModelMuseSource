    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">Users of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) may find some similarities between Objects in ModelMuse and coverages in a GIS. There are, however, significant differences as well. The precise characteristics of a GIS coverage may vary among implementations in different software and formats. Shapefiles (</text><text styleclass="Reference" translate="true">Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., 1998)</text><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">, one example of a GIS coverage, resemble Objects in that they comprise points, polylines, polygons (and some other shapes) associated with attributes. &#160;Unlike objects, however, all the shapes in a Shapefile are associated with the same kinds of attributes. &#160;In contrast, the data sets associated with one object are not necessarily the same as the data sets associated with another object. &#160;The values of the attributes associated with a shape in a Shapefile are simple types and thus do not vary from place to place within a shape. &#160;With objects, the formula for a data set is evaluated at different locations and can give a different value at each such location. &#160;Both objects and shapes have strict rules regarding what is and is not a valid geometry; however, the rules are not the same for both of them. &#160;In shapes with multiple sections, for example, no section can overlap any other section, whereas in Objects, overlapping sections are allowed. &#160;Another difference between shapes and Objects is that all the shapes in a Shapefile must be of the same type; combinations of points, polylines, and polygons in the same Shapefile are not allowed. &#160;Objects have no such restriction. In summary, shapes in a Shapefile tend to be much more homogeneous than are Objects in ModelMuse.</text></para>
